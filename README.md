## How to Upload Cosmetics

### 1. Create a New Repository or Fork This One
Fork this repository to make your changes. This allows you to contribute without modifying the original repository directly.

### 2. Add Your Cosmetics
Here are the types of cosmetics you can add:

- **Backpacks**: Place your backpack files in the `cosmetics/backpacks/` folder.
- **Hats**: Place your hat files in the `cosmetics/hats/` folder.
- **Capes**: Place cape files in the `cosmetics/capes/` folder.
- **Balloons**: For balloon cosmetics, put the files in the `cosmetics/balloons/` folder.

Ensure each cosmetic file is correctly formatted (e.g., textures as `.png`, models as `.json`.).

### 3. Update Configuration Files
If you add a new cosmetic category or option, make sure to update the configuration files in the appropriate `config/` folder. Document any new parameters or variables you add.

### 4. Test Your Code
Before submitting a pull request, test your changes locally on your server to ensure everything works as expected.

### 5. Create a Pull Request
Once your changes are complete:
1. Ensure youâ€™ve committed your changes to your fork.
2. Go to the repository page and create a pull request (PR).
3. In your PR description, explain all the changes you've made. This helps reviewers understand what has been added.
   - **Example:** "Added a new backpack cosmetic that players can equip. It includes a leather bag with a custom texture."

### 6. Code Review and Merging
A team member will review the PR and ensure all standards are met. Once the review is complete, the PR will be merged into the main repository.

### 7. Cosmetics on the Server
After the merge, your new cosmetic will automatically be available on **onthepixel.net**. Players will be able to use it in-game based on the configurations and conditions you added.

## Notes

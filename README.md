## âœ¨ How to Add Cosmetics  

### 1. Fork the Repository  
Start by forking this repository. This allows you to make changes without directly modifying the original codebase.  

### 2. Add Your Cosmetics  
Here are the cosmetic categories you can add:  

- **Backpacks**: Place your backpack files in the `cosmetics/backpacks/` folder.  
- **Hats**: Place your hat files in the `cosmetics/hats/` folder.  
- **Capes**: Place your cape files in the `cosmetics/capes/` folder.  
- **Balloons**: Place your balloon files in the `cosmetics/balloons/` folder.  

Ensure your files are properly formatted (e.g., textures as `.png`, models as `.json`).  

### 3. Update Configuration Files  
If you add a new category or option, make sure to update the relevant configuration files in the `config/` folder. Document any new parameters or variables you've introduced.  

### 4. Test Your Changes  
Before submitting a pull request, test your additions locally on your server to make sure everything works as expected.  

### 5. Create a Pull Request  
Once you're ready, follow these steps:  
1. Commit your changes to your fork.  
2. Go to the repository page and create a pull request (PR).  
3. In your PR description, explain your changes in detail so reviewers understand what has been added.  
   - **Example**: "Added a new backpack cosmetic featuring a custom leather texture."  

### 6. Code Review & Merging  
A team member will review your pull request to ensure everything meets our standards. Once the review is complete, your PR will be merged into the main repository.  

### 7. Claiming Your Cosmetic In-Game  
Once your cosmetic is approved and merged, you can generate up to **100 codes** (or more after discussion) through our **Discord** using the command:  

```
/cosmetics
```  

Players can redeem a cosmetic in-game by using the command:
